Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The web service instance should be in the private subnet 1, and only reachable through the application load balancer.

# Poor practice 2
The s3 bucket should have a VPC endpoint in the private subnet 1 and not be accessed by the web service instance through internet.
